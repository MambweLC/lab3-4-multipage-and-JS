Page Descriptions
1. Home Page (index.html)
The home page features a welcoming hero section with a brief introduction to the website. Below the hero section, two side-by-side sections (using Flexbox) provide more details about the website and its latest updates.

2. Services Page (services.html)
This page displays four service cards arranged in a grid layout using CSS Grid. Each card contains an image, a heading, and a brief description. The cards have hover effects to enhance interactivity.

3. Contact Page (contact.html)
The contact page includes a styled HTML5 form with fields for name, email, subject, and message. The form utilizes built-in HTML5 validation. It also includes subtle animations for button hover and input field focus.

Summary of Features Used
Selectors: Used various CSS selectors, including element selectors (e.g., nav ul li), class selectors (e.g., .hero), and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :focus) to style different elements.

Flexbox: Used Flexbox on the home page to create a responsive layout for two sections (intro and sidebar). Flexbox ensures that the layout adapts well to various screen sizes.

Grid: Utilized CSS Grid on the services page to create a flexible grid of four service cards. The grid adjusts automatically based on screen size, showing fewer columns as the screen size decreases.

Media Queries: Added media queries to ensure the website is responsive across various screen sizes:

max-width: 1024px: Adjusts layout for tablet-sized screens.

max-width: 768px: Further tweaks for smaller screens like tablets in portrait mode.

max-width: 480px: Adjustments for mobile devices to stack elements and ensure proper spacing.

Animation: Implemented subtle hover animations using @keyframes for buttons and input focus transitions to improve user experience.
